                    I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I
                    learned were current, if not more so, in the company I
                    joined. I honestly feel I got every penny‚Äôs worth.

                    ‚Äú I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp.
                    I‚Äôve been looking to make a transition and have heard some
                    people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for
                    the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I
                    enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best
                    - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the
                    course, I‚Äôve successfully switched careers, working as a
                    Software Engineer at a VR startup. ‚Äù

                    Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp
                    themselves. Getting guidance from them and learning from

                    necessary to be able to go out in the world and present
                    myself as a capable junior developer. The standard is above

                <div class="testimonial__grid5__row3">
                    ‚Äú Before joining the bootcamp, I‚Äôve never written a line of
                    code. I needed some structure from professionals who can
                    help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to
                    enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say
                    wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum
                    and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I
                    never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team
                    project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning
                    to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have.
                    In fact, I‚Äôve often referred to it during interviews as an
                    example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me
                    land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving
                    multiple offers. 100% recommend! ‚Äù
